What webkitpony is about
==========================

webkitpony is a micro framework to build desktop applications with web technologies.
Its a lightweight piece of code sitting on top of the webkit rendering engine enabling 
a django-like development process for desktop applications.
Take a look at the demo project "ponyhof". The structure will look familiar to all djangonauts.
